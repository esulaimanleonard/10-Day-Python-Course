# A list is a container for an ordered sequence of items.
# We access items using an index, which starts from 0.

# YOUR CODE HERE - Practice accessing single items:
# 1. Create a list of your three favorite foods.
# 2. Print the entire list.
# 3. Print the food that is your absolute favorite (the first one).
# 4. Print your least favorite of the three (the last one).
# YOUR CODE HERE:

# YOUR CODE HERE - Practice slicing:
# 1. Create a list of the days of the week: ["Mon", "Tue", "Wed", "Thu", "Fri", "Sat", "Sun"]
# 2. Create a slice containing just the weekdays.
# 3. Create a slice containing just the weekend.
# 4. Print both slices.
